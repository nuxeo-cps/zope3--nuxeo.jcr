- the protocol must deal with writes

- the protocol must deal with transactions

- the jython server must deal with transactions using JOTM

- the connection must be able to reconnect on network problem

- the connection must deal with transactions (also in conjunction with
  reconnects)

Maybe later

- link with an external transaction manager (new server type?)

- link with an external message bus (add a new server type)
